# About
HNTYD is a virtual pet simulator where you are challenged to raise Goober, your pet dragon, while trying not to kill it (optional). The goal of the game is to buy food (Goober gets reallly hungry) and other supplementary items to maintain good balance of Goober's three main attributes - health, hunger and fun. As you can see, earning coins is the most important thing for Goober to stay alive. Minigames and gambling (Goober's favourite thing to do) are going to be the main source of money. But beware, playing minigames is going to affect health of Goober negatievely, so you need to balance playing minigames with other activities. The primary goal of the player is to unlock all of the endings (There are 2 for now).

This project is still in active development, so stay tuned for more stuff.

All of the in-game art components are original (made by our artists)

Created for the 2025 BMO NXT LVL x TMU WINTER GAME JAM in under 2 days (first version)
