# How Not to Train Your Dragon (C# Build)

Welcome to the C# build of the project. It is soon to work the same as the main branch, with improvements in the code architecture and more QOL changes.

This branch is currently a WIP but will be receiving more updates in the near future and be on par with the main branch.
